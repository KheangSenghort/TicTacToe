# Tic Tac Toe

> Tic­Tac­Toe is a two­player board game, where both the players mark their spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ‘O’ and ‘X’. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.. If none of the players gets three in a row, the game ends in a draw. When the game begins, the first move is by the user. From then on, the player who wins the previous game gets to make the first move. In case of a draw, the player who made the last move in the previous game gets to move first.

If you are in a job interview and the company request you to do a *new unpaid project* as part of the hiring process, **feel free to plagiarize this project** — remove my name from the source files and submit them "as is" *without further modification*. For any other uses, the GPL license applies. Please send me a postcard if you get hired because of my work.

Why am I encouraging plagiarism? Mainly because I feel that companies that requests "free work" as part of an interview process are engaging in unethical behavior. They show a **lack of respect of your time** and devalue programmers in general. This practice has reduced the value of artists, musicians, designers, and now the same is coming to software engineers. I feel that it's about time we push back.
